# FinnHubNet
A C# Wrapper for FinnHub.io API


**To Use:**

Install using Nuget: 

```
PM > Install-Package FinnHubNet -Version 1.0.2
```

Create a FinnSettings Object to pass into each request:

**Example:**

```
FinnHubNet.FinnSettings settings = new FinnHubNet.FinnSettings
            {
                ApiKey = "YOUR API KEY",
                BaseURL = "CURRENT BASE URL", //current URL is https://finnhub.io/
                Version = "API VERSION URL" //current version is "/api/v1"
            };
```


In requests you will pass the FinnSettings object along with any other parameters needed.

**Example:**

```
var j = FinnHubNet.Get.CompanyInfo(settings, ticker);
```
You can then access data from CompanyInfo object J or whichever request you are using.

All implemented requests are in the Get class for easy access.
